# BizForecast-EcoTrends

BizForecast-EcoTrends is an analytical framework developed by Rajat Maheshwari to provide economic trend forecasting through the analysis of inwards and outwards goods quantities. This tool employs Python 3 and utilizes the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) statistical model to predict future trends, aiding businesses in making data-driven decisions.

## Features
- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Simplifies the preparation of data from diverse Excel files for analysis.
- **ARIMA Time Series Forecasting**: Harnesses the ARIMA model for robust forecasting of economic quantities.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates comprehensive graphs that display historical trends and predictive forecasts.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before running BizForecast-EcoTrends, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib statsmodels
```

### Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BizForecast-EcoTrends.git
cd BizForecast-EcoTrends
```

## Usage
The project is structured into two primary components:

### Data Cleaning
To clean your data, run:
```bash
python3 Data_Cleaning.py
```
*Note: The data cleaning script requires your own dataset due to privacy considerations.*

### Forecasting
Execute the forecasting script using:
```bash
python3 forecast.py
```
This will output the forecast graph for the next quarter.

## Example Output
Here is an example of a graph produced by the `forecast.py` script:
